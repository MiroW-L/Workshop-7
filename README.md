# Workshop-7


## Start me up (31/1/25)
- Watching Leo's video guide, quite interested to see the limits of what a simulkation swarm might be capable of, especially withing the limits of p5.js or VS Code. Earlier on I had checked out this guide on p5.js which was really incredibel to me: https://p5js.org/examples/classes-and-objects-flocking/
- I copied everything Leo did and created a small triangle swarm called Nippers and I made them green
- Then I got an idea after making little black dots appear after drawing a point with the triangles. I thought this exacle resembled a kiwifruit and I decided that I needed to make the background brown so it matched.
- I finished this and felt super pleased about it, I am curious about if I can make teams and simulate a sort of battle possibly.
